In extract.awk is a logic of converting trace to a datafile that splot undestands.
Color setting of tracepoints is also located there.

Usage:

Let `your_trace_file` be your copy of /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace

` awk '{print $1}' your_trace_file | sort -u `
will give a list of all different task names that are recorded in the trace.

Let `your_task_name` be a task name that you are investigating

` grep your_task_name your_trace_file | ./extract.awk > your_trace_file.data `
will convert trace file to a data that splot understands.

Example of using splot:
` splot -w 1000 -h 500 -tickInterval 1 -legendWidth 150 -tf elapsed -o your_trace_file.png -if your_trace_file.data -fromTime 227.758 -toTime 227.7611`
